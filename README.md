## 👋 Hi, I’m Shannon

I’m a software engineer focused on **billing systems, data migrations, and production safety at scale**.

Currently, I work on **subscriptions and payments infrastructure**, where I own revenue-critical systems, large historical data migrations, and cross-database schema evolution under live production traffic.

---

## 🧠 What I work on

- Stripe-based billing and subscription systems  
- Production-safe data migrations (hundreds of millions to ~1B rows)  
- Schema evolution and data model simplification  
- Performance tradeoffs across indexing, batching, and storage  
- Systems that must be **correct**, not just fast  

---

## 🔧 Technologies

- **Languages:** TypeScript, SQL  
- **Systems:** GCP, Cloud SQL, BigQuery, Terraform  
- **Data & APIs:** GraphQL (Relay), relational databases  
- **Domains:** Billing, payments, large-scale data migrations

## 📌 Background

Before engineering, I studied **Philosophy and Classics**, which strongly shapes how I approach system design, tradeoffs, and correctness. I’ve also lived and worked abroad, including serving as an **English Educator and Teacher Trainer** in South Africa.

I’m especially interested in work that sits at the intersection of:
- correctness  
- scale  
- and business-critical systems
